Incident Response and Forensics

Incident response and computer forensics are closely related disciplines in the field of cybersecurity. While incident response focuses on the immediate response and 
management of security incidents, computer forensics deals with the collection, analysis, and preservation of digital evidence related to those incidents. Here's a brief overview of 
each:
• Incident Response:
• Incident response involves the structured and coordinated approach to managing and mitigating the impact of security incidents. The main objectives of incident response are to 
minimize damage, identify the source and nature of the incident, and restore normal operations as quickly as possible. Key activities in incident response include:
- Preparation: Establishing incident response plans, defining roles and responsibilities, and implementing necessary technical controls.
- Detection and Analysis: Monitoring systems and networks for signs of security incidents, analyzing indicators of compromise, and determining the scope and severity of 
the incident.
- Containment and Eradication: Taking immediate actions to contain the incident, prevent further damage, and remove the cause from affected systems.
- Recovery and Remediation: Restoring affected systems to their normal operational state, implementing additional security controls, and patching vulnerabilities to prevent 
similar incidents in the future.
- Post-Incident Analysis: Conducting a thorough analysis of the incident, identifying lessons learned, and implementing improvements to enhance incident response 
capabilities.
• Computer Forensics:
• Computer forensics is the application of scientific methods and techniques to collect, analyze, and preserve digital evidence for legal or investigative purposes. It involves the 
systematic and meticulous examination of digital artifacts to reconstruct events, establish facts, and support legal proceedings. Key aspects of computer forensics include:
• Evidence Collection: Identifying and preserving digital evidence in a forensically sound manner to ensure its integrity and admissibility in legal proceedings.
• Analysis and Examination: Conducting in-depth analysis of digital artifacts, such as hard drives, memory dumps, network logs, and application data, to extract relevant 
information and uncover the sequence of events.
